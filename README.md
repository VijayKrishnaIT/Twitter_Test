# Twitter Test

## Your task is to build a very simple version of the Twitter timeline using React and ES6.

### Requirements:

- The UI should consist of a new tweet text input, a submit button, and a timeline consisting of tweets.
- New tweets submitted by the "logged in user" should be added to the timeline
- Create whatever components you might need to build this UI.
- We've provided a Tweet component and a parent component called MiniTwitter already added to the DOM. Take a look at MiniTwitter's state.
